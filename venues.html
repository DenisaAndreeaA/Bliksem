      <p style="color:#e6e6e6;font-size:20px">When thoughts of Eindhoven come to mind many visitors think of the industry<br>
      and technology centres like DAF, Philips and ASML that have made this city <br>
      so popular with Dutch citizens and expats alike. However, behind this science <br>
      exterior lies a love for music and culture! Live music in the city is a great<br>
      way to spend an evening with good family and friends or enjoy a bigger concert<br>
      in one of the larger concert venues within the city. The nightlife of Eindhoven<br>
      has always been a fun and interesting aspect of the city with many different<br>
      genres to suit every person, even the hard to please people! Local bands are <br>
      playing in some of the many pubs along the Stratumseind, Market Square, or<br>
      Wilhelmina plein. Many of the smaller venues within the city do not require <br>
      patrons to pay to see live bands playing, which is great if you do not want an<br>
      extremely expensive night out on the town. There are sometimes small fees for<br>
      some of the performances, but it is worth the little bit of money to experience<br>
      some of the local talent! </p>
